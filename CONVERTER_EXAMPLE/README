   This directory gives an example of how to use the 
IODA converter on a sample bufr file.

   In the DATA directory, there is a test input bufr 
file named adpsfc. It only contains "ADPSFC" data.

   The testoutput directory is where the resultant 
IODA-format netcdf file will be placed one the 
converter is run.

   You must compile the code to retrieve the converter
and place it into this main directory in order for
this to work.

   In this directory, there is a sample environment file
On Hera, sourcing this file will put you in the 
enviroment needed to run the converter.

   The yaml file is what the converter uses to determine
how to format the netcdf file. You may choose to go 
into it and look around before you run the converter.
You may also choose to change the name of the output
file (line 79 at obsdataout). 

   To run the converter:

1. Copy the bufr2ioda.x converter to this directory.

2. Make sure the environment is correct. On Hera, 
simply source the env_bufr2ioda file.
$> source env_bufr2ioda 

3. Run the following command:
$> ./bufr2ioda.x bufr_adpsfc.yaml

  Once this is done, the resulting IODA-formatted
netcdf file will be in the testoutput directory.
The "ncdump" command will show you what is in the
file.
